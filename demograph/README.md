# Introduction

This Gitbook is a work-in-progress towards a complete specification of **Demograph**.

## Goals

The goal of Demograph is to scale open, real-time collaboration. Open collaboration implies that it should handle the potential scale involved and reflects the true ambitions. Streamline the interactions of billions of people such that it continues to make sense to all participants.

Demograph builds on top of Odin that provides the primitives for open data exchange. It extends Odin with algorithms, protocols and data-structures required to process the large number of interactions in meaningful ways.
